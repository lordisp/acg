# Cloud scipts library

This repo contains some scripts that I created during the online training on [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com).

At the beginning, the content will mainly be focused on Azure cloud. Other cloud providers such as AWS or GCP will follow. The aim is not to spoil the content of A Cloud Guru, but only to store a few reminders.
