# Cloud scripts library

This repo contains some scripts that I created during the online training on [A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com).

At the beginning, the content will mainly be focused on Azure cloud. Other cloud providers such as AWS or GCP will follow. The aim is not to spoil the content of A Cloud Guru, but only to store a few reminders.

## How to use

> Please note that these scripts are far from being tested or ideally developed. These only serve as a playground for my ACG labs.

You can run the scripts out of the root directory of this repository.

Example:

```powershell
.\azure\powershell\deploay-function.ps1
```

If you run any of the scripts for the first time and the .env file under `.\azure\powershell\` does not exist, you will be asked to enter a username and password.
A helper function will create an `.env` file with the credentials for your. You can also create one manually based on the `.env.example` file.
> Make sure this will be ignored in your `.gitignore` file.  

These credentials are temporarily only and generated by the ACG laps
You will be asked to enter username and password in the terminal if the file does not exist. These credentials are provided by the sandbox panel.
